Commonly-used workflows tools at ALCF include `Parsl <https://parsl-project.org/>`_, `Balsam <https://balsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and `Swift <http://swift-lang.org/main/>`_. Workflow technology is rapidly evolving, as project teams consider how to best run jobs that combine simulation and AI, campaigns of thousands to millions of jobs, or workloads with diverse parallelism. Projects often invent their own approach to workflows, or have integrated with other workflow toolkits; ALCF welcomes these approaches and aims to work with users to achieve simple, efficient workflow solutions for users.
