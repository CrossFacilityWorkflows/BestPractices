Identity Management
===================

Identity management across facilities remains a challenge.
There are currently not any multi-site solutions in place that simplify
creating and managing identities across the DOE sites.  However, there
are various efforts underway that should address these challenges
in the future.  Currently, users will need to request allocations
and accounts at each site.  Below are pointers for each site describing
how to get allocations and establish access.

In order to get an account at NERSC, you will need an allocation
to assoicate with your account.  If you are part of an existing project,
you can specify that project when you request your account.  Otherwise,
you will need to request an allocation via ERCAP.  Accounts and allocations
are managed via IRIS (https://iris.nersc.gov).

NERSC is in the process of adding support for Federated Identity management.  This is described
in detail here.
