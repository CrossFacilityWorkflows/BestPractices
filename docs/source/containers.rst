Containers
==========
This page documents container infrastructure available at each site.

`Containers` are an approach to bundling all of the required files and data for an application as a single file, so the dependencies are fully `contained` and referenced at runtime, removing concerns over changes in underlying system dependencies which can render an application unusable. The resulting container can be moved between systems and still run, since its dependencies are fully satisfied local to the container.

Applications deployed in containers typically run with little to no degradation in performance. This is in line with expectations, and is especially applicable in the context of applications with significant dependence on the filesystem, such as Python applications (which typically load many module files at startup), dynamically linked applications (which need to load shared object files, as opposed to the single-file statically linked applications), and applications with a significant data dependency, where those data dependencies can be included in the container. The reason in all of these cases is that the number of references to files on the remote filesystem is reduced, as they are resolved to the compute node-local container instead.

ALCF deploys Singularity for use on the Theta system, including both the Intel KNL and NVIDIA A100 nodes. Singularity images can be derived from pre-existing Docker images, or built directly using Singularity recipes. Containerized applications have run successfully on Theta up to 4096 nodes with Singularity.

Full details about using Singularity at ALCF can be found on the ALCF documentation site, for both `Theta <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/theta/singularity-theta/>`_ and `ThetaGPU <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/theta-gpu-nodes/nvidia-containers>`_. Further details about Singularity at ALCF are also available in materials from the ALCF Computational Performance workshop, `here <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/theta-gpu-nodes/nvidia-containers>`_.

`Shifter <https://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/user-defined-images/>`_
is a software package that allows user-created images to run at NERSC.
These images can be `Docker images <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/>`_ or other formats.
Using Shifter you can create an image with your desired operating system and easily 
install your software stacks and dependencies. 
If you make your image in Docker, it can also be run at any other computing center that is Docker friendly. 
Shifter also comes with improvements in performance, especially for shared libraries. 
It is currently the best performing option for python code stacks across multiple nodes. 
For full information on using Shifter at NERSC, please see `this page <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/shifter/how-to-use/>`_.
